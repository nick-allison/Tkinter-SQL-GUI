# Tkinter SQL GUI

This project is a simple Tkinter-based GUI that interfaces with a remote SQL server, performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and executing custom SQL queries. It demonstrates a clear understanding of database management and SQL operations, highlighting my ability to interact programmatically with databases.

**Note**: The remote server initially used for this project has been taken down. However, the code remains functional. To connect it to a new SQL server, simply replace the relevant server connection information at the top of the script.

## Features
- **CRUD Operations**: The GUI has dedicated buttons for each Create, Read, Update, and Delete operation.
- **Basic Operations**: Additional buttons are provided for other specific queries that may be popular, such as fetching certain rows or performing aggregations. These can easily be modified in the code to suit new use cases.
- **Custom Queries**: Includes an input field to send custom SQL queries to the database, supporting more complex queries.

## Demonstrated Skills
This project demonstrates:
- **Database Management**: Understanding of database architecture, connection, and management using SQL.
- **SQL Proficiency**: Ability to perform CRUD operations and write custom queries for interacting with a relational database.
- **Python Development**: Experience working with Python libraries like Tkinter for GUI development and MySQL Connector for database communication.
- **Problem Solving**: Practical implementation of a tool that can be customized and connected to any SQL server.

## Why This Matters
As I look to move into the fields of data science and AI, understanding how to manage, interact with, and query databases is crucial. This project showcases my proficiency in working with databases, which is a fundamental skill in both data science and machine learning. By building this project, I have gained hands-on experience with databases and Python, preparing me for roles that involve data handling and processing.
